# testcase-builder
A simple Python script that can be used to test a software application:

This script uses the built-in unittest library in Python to define a test case for a software application. The test case includes four test methods: test_login, test_logout, test_create_user, test_update_user,test_delete_user which test different functionality of the application. Each method makes a call to the corresponding function of the application and checks the response against expected output.

It's important to note that this is just an example and the actual test methods and their implementation will depend on the software you want to test.

It's also important to note that this script is just a skeleton and it doesn't include the actual implementations of the methods login, logout, create_user,update_user and delete_user. These methods should be implemented by the tester according to the software under test.
